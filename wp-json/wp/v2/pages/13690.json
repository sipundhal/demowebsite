The rules represent an important framework for lawyers\u2019 professional ethics. The regulations provide that a lawyer\u2019s primary obligation is a duty of loyalty to the client. This means that the lawyer must work in the client\u2019s best interests and safeguard those interests. Complementing the duty of loyalty, there are rules on avoiding conflicts of interest. A further important duty is that of confidentiality. The duty of confidentiality covers information to which the lawyer has become privy within the scope of their practice of law. If a lawyer does not abide by the Code of Professional Conduct, they may be subject to disciplinary measures imposed by the Bar Association.<\/p>\n<h2>Terms and Conditions<\/h2>\n<p>Our services are subject to our Terms and Conditions, which define for our clients how we work and what clients can expect.

The purpose of the reporting obligation is to combat tax evasion, tax fraud and tax avoidance. An arrangement is reportable if it is cross-border and displays certain hallmarks indicating there may be a risk of tax avoidance. Arrangements implemented without tax reasons may also be reportable. It should also be noted that the reporting obligation covers advisers involved in a given matter, whether or not they have provided tax advice.<\/p>\n<p>The Swedish Bar Association has issued a clarification, stating that Advocates (<em>a<\/em><em>dvokater<\/em>) are exempt from the reporting obligation under DAC6, since it would breach our duty of confidentiality. This means that our lawyers will not report any arrangements to the Swedish Tax Agency unless our client expressly instructs us to do so, and in so doing releases us from our duty of confidentiality. If we do not receive any such instructions from our client, other advisers (and failing that, the client) are responsible for reporting the arrangement. According to the Bar Association, we cannot inform other advisers of their reporting obligation without breaching our duty of confidentiality.<\/p>\n<h2>Information about processing of personal data by Mannheimer Swartling<\/h2>\n<p>We care about individual privacy and protecting the personal data processed by the firm.
