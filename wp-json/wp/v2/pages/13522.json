Achieving change demands that we lead by example and accept social responsibility for that which we are capable of influencing. Mannheimer Swartling has worked with sustainability issues for many years within a framework of three pillars: sustainability in our legal advice, internally within the firm, and in society.<\/p>\n<p>Our legal services are the core of the firm\u2019s business. We have specialist groups with focused expertise in sustainability \u2013 but sustainability-related challenges arise throughout all our practice groups and areas of law. It is crucial that our legal advice continues to drive the development towards a more sustainable business sector \u2013 both for the stakeholders of today as well as those of future generations.<\/p>\n<p>Our internal sustainability work focuses on issues that are central to both the firm and the wider legal profession, such as skills and development, health and wellbeing, diversity and inclusion, climate and the environment, and ethics and compliance.<\/p>\n<p>In society, we support selected organisations and activities on a pro bono advisory basis and we participate in various community initiatives to strengthen the wider contribution to a more sustainable society.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-24256\" src=\"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/mannheimer-swartling-sam-en-1200x489.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"489\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/mannheimer-swartling-sam-en-1200x489.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/mannheimer-swartling-sam-en-2000x815.jpg 2000w, https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/mannheimer-swartling-sam-en-800x326.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/mannheimer-swartling-sam-en-768x313.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/mannheimer-swartling-sam-en-1536x626.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/mannheimer-swartling-sam-en-2048x835.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Sustainable by design<\/h2>\n<p>Our Sustainable by design concept aims to embed the horizontal integration of the firm\u2019s sustainability values and objectives into our daily operations. We currently focus the concept on our core business \u2013 from the arrival of a matter from a client, to the advice provided and the lessons and experiences that we bring to each new matter. By mapping the course of a matter, the common elements and the outcomes, we gain a clearer picture of the relationship between cause and effect in our sustainability work and in the firm\u2019s overall business strategy.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-24259\" src=\"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/mannheimer-swartling-sbd-en-1200x489.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"489\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/mannheimer-swartling-sbd-en-1200x489.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/mannheimer-swartling-sbd-en-2000x815.jpg 2000w, https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/mannheimer-swartling-sbd-en-800x326.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/mannheimer-swartling-sbd-en-768x313.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/mannheimer-swartling-sbd-en-1536x626.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/app\/uploads\/2023\/05\/mannheimer-swartling-sbd-en-2048x835.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><em>Sustainability from the start<\/em> concerns which matters and questions we choose to work on.
