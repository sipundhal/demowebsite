Our strength across the entire business law field has provided for a long tradition of working on the most significant transactions in the Swedish market.<\/p>\n<p>Our mandates cover the full spectrum of M&amp;A work, including auction processes, negotiated deals, joint ventures, carve-outs, share transfers, asset deals and M&amp;A insurance. Our client base includes industrials, private equity, late-phase startups, banks and other financial institutions, as well as clients operating in the public sector.<\/p>\n<h2>Innovation and digitalisation<\/h2>\n<p>We are always looking for new ways to develop and streamline our working methods. The M&amp;A practice works closely with MSA Innovation Lab to improve processes and digitise elements of our work. Our clients benefit from our platforms for project management, coordination, co-authoring, automated drafting and AI-driven discovery. This is particularly helpful where we have a project management role in multijurisdictional and multifaceted transactions but it also enables us to efficiently handle smaller matters and add-on acquisitions.<\/p>\n<h2>International<\/h2>\n<p>Swedish companies operate globally and are among some of the most recognisable brands and the most pioneering businesses in the world.
