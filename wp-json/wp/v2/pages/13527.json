Here we focus on topics such as ethics, compliance and diversity, as well as climate and environmental matters, for instance, relating to sustainable travel and purchasing.<\/p>\n<h2>Our people<\/h2>\n<p>As a knowledge-based company, Mannheimer Swartling is wholly dependent on the professional qualities and personal skills of our employees. An important part of our internal sustainability work therefore relates to attracting, developing and retaining the best staff. We focus on the areas of skills and development, health and wellbeing, and diversity and inclusion.<\/p>\n<h2>Ethics and regulatory compliance<\/h2>\n<p>\u200bEthics and regulatory compliance are embodied within our core values and are of great importance to our day-to-day tasks and the long-term development of the firm. Our operational risk management and compliance work is managed by the firm\u2019s Compliance and Risk department. This team identifies and assesses rules and risks relating to the acceptance of new clients and matters, and continuously manages ethical and strategic challenges in the advisory business.<\/p>\n<h2>Climate and the environment<\/h2>\n<p>The firm\u2019s internal sustainability work also focuses on minimising our own negative impact on the environment through initiatives such as sustainable travel and purchasing. We were one of the first in the legal industry to adopt an environmental policy and to environmentally certify our Swedish offices according to ISO 14001. With the help of external experts, we also perform an annual assessment and analysis of our climate footprint to further reduce our negative impact. In 2021, we joined the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), committing the firm to set scientifically based targets in accordance with the objectives of the Paris Agreement \u2013 to limit global warming to well below 2\u00b0C and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C. In 2022, our targets were independently assessed and approved by SBTi. The firm\u2019s commitment is to more than halve our carbon footprint by 2030.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Environmental-policy-Eng.pdf\">Read our environmental policy here.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our internal sustainability work reflects the values that the firm represents and creates a workplace where every employee can thrive and develop.
