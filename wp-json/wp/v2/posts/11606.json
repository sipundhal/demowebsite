The judgment of the Patent- and Market Court of Appeal is an important contribution to the law on anti-competitive agreements, in particular clarifying the conditions under which an agreement may, without assessing the agreement&#8217;s effects on the market, be deemed anti-competitive by its very nature (an agreement with an anti-competitive object). The Court accepted Capio&#8217;s submission that the scope for finding an agreement anti-competitive by object is strictly limited. No anti-competitive effects had been demonstrated in the case and Capio was consequently acquitted and awarded full compensation for costs.<\/p>\n<p>Capio was represented by Mannheimer Swartling.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Patent- and Market Court of Appeal has rejected a claim by the Swedish Competition Authority that Capio S:t G\u00f6rans sjukhus, Sweden&#8217;s only privately run\u2026<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[4313],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-11606","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-assignment","business-group-eu-and-competition"],"acf":[],"lang":"en","translations":{"en":11606,"sv":11603},"pll_sync_post":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/11606"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/8"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=11606"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/11606\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":14661,"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/11606\/revisions\/14661"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=11606"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=11606"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=11606"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
