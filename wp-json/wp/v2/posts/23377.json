The SFSA is responsible for issuing such guidance. The Pillar 2 Guidance aims to ensure that banks have sufficient capital during a financial downturn.<\/p>\n<p>On 30 September 2021 the SFSA notified Klarna of a Pillar 2 Guidance. Klarna appealed the SFSA&#8217;s decision to the Administrative Court in Stockholm and on 1 December 2022 the Administrative Court handed down its judgement in the case.<\/p>\n<p>The Administrative Court ruled that the SFSA had not made a sufficient assessment of Klarna&#8217;s specific characteristics, and the extent to which these set Klarna apart from more traditional banks.
