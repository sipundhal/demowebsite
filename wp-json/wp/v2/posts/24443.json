We understand that the road to university can feel long \u2013 perhaps even more so for those whose families do not have an academic background or who have studied outside Sweden. Our goal is to make the road feel shorter.<\/p>\n<p>The programme runs for two years and you will have two mentors to provide support and follow your development throughout the programme. You will also participate in activities such as exciting study visits and have the opportunity to practice your presentation skills.<\/p>\n<p>The first group of participants have just had their final meeting, and it has been fantastic to follow their development. We wish them all the best for the future. We are now looking forward to meeting our new participants!<\/p>\n<p>The application period for 2023 is open until 30 September.
