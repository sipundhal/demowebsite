The purpose is to inspire and support students in their journey towards an academic future.<\/p>\n<p>Study for Life accepts applications from students who have just finished their first year of high school (gymnasium) and come from families where neither parent has a Swedish academic education. Each participant will have two mentors to follow their development and provide support. Programme activities include study visits, inspirational lectures and the opportunity to develop practical skills such as presentation giving.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; The goal is to make the road to university feel shorter. The majority of our employees have their roots in Sweden, and this is not unusual in our industry sector. We hope that Study for Life will contribute to increased diversity \u2013 both at Swedish universities and hopefully also in the business community, says Jan Dernestam, Managing Partner at Mannheimer Swartling.<\/p>\n<p>Azadeh Razani and Sixto Rios are both involved as mentors in Study for Life.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; For me, it has been important to have role models and mentors for inspiration and support. Sometimes, your own thoughts can be the thing standing in your way. A chat with a mentor can hopefully inspire students and give them that extra \u201cpush\u201d, says Azadeh Razani, Partner at Mannheimer Swartling.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; I came to Sweden when I was 18 years old. I could not speak a single word of Swedish back then. It is thanks to hard work \u2013 and a little bit of luck \u2013 that I have been able to pursue a career in financial law at Sweden&#8217;s biggest law firm. Good academic grades opened a lot of doors for me, says Sixto Rios, Senior Associate at Mannheimer Swartling.<\/p>\n<p>For more information, please contact:<\/p>\n<p>Jan Dernestam, Managing Partner<br \/>\n+46 70 977 73 48, jan.dernestam@msa.se<\/p>\n<p>Helena Sj\u00f6holm, Head of Marketing and Communications<br \/>\n+46 70 977 79 34, helena.sjoholm@msa.se<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Studera f\u00f6r livet, or \u201cStudy for Life\u201d, is Mannheimer Swartling\u2019s new Study and Mentoring programme for students who have just finished their first year of\u2026<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":9,"featured_media":18563,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[7],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-18573","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-news-about-the-firm"],"acf":[],"lang":"en","translations":{"en":18573,"sv":18561},"pll_sync_post":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/18573"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/9"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=18573"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/18573\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":18574,"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/18573\/revisions\/18574"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/18563"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=18573"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=18573"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=18573"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
