The judgment is an important precedent in the field of merger control and will have an impact in the years to come. It is the first judgment from an appeals court and the first judgment to go against the Swedish Competition Authority in merger control cases since 1998. The buyer Logstor was represented by Mannheimer Swartling.<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<footer class=\"no-content\"><\/footer>\n<\/div>\n<footer class=\"keel\">\n<div class=\"footer-content-container container\">\n<div class=\"company-information\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/footer>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In its first major competition law decision since it began operations in September, the newly established Patent- and Market Court of Appeal on 24 November\u2026<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[4313],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-11351","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-assignment"],"acf":[],"lang":"en","translations":{"en":11351,"sv":11349},"pll_sync_post":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/11351"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/8"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=11351"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/11351\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":14958,"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/11351\/revisions\/14958"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=11351"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=11351"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=11351"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
