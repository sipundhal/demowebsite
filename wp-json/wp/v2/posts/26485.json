The guarantees cover 80% and 95% of the loan amount respectively, and are provided in accordance with market pricing. The group of over 20 lenders includes Svensk Exportkredit (SEK) and the European Investment Bank together with commercial banks, led by BNP Paribas, ING, KfW IPEX-Bank, Societe Generale and UniCredit. The junior debt consortium is led by AIP Management and comprises European and international investment banks and funds.<\/p>\n<p>In relation to the equity raise of close to EUR 300 million, new shareholders include Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund, Mubea and Siemens Financial Services. Additionally, IMAS Foundation and Just Climate are some of the existing shareholders which are increasing their investments in H2 Green Steel.<\/p>\n<p>The new financing marks a major milestone in H2 Green Steel\u2019s journey to accelerate the decarbonisation of the steel industry through the world\u2019s first large-scale green steel plant. Founded in 2020, H2 Green Steel aims to decarbonise hard-to-abate industries, starting by producing steel with up to 95% lower CO2 emissions than steel made with coke-fired blast furnaces.<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8221;No one has scrutinised our project more thoroughly than those who back our financing. This massive commitment from our lenders, investors and the Innovation Fund is true recognition of the quality of our company. It\u2019s also a big win for the climate as we hope the model will inspire the financing of other decarbonisation initiatives in hard-to-abate industries,\u201d<\/em> says Henrik Henriksson, CEO of H2 Green Steel.<\/p>\n<p>H2 Green Steel was advised by Mannheimer Swartling in the transaction.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>H2 Green Steel has signed definitive debt financing agreements for EUR 4.2 billion in project financing and increased the previously announced equity raised by EUR\u2026<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":16,"featured_media":26482,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[7],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-26485","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-news-about-the-firm","business-group-banking-and-finance","business-group-corporate-taxation","business-group-emerging-and-growth-companies","business-group-funds-and-investments","business-group-mergers-and-acquisitions"],"acf":[],"lang":"en","translations":{"en":26485,"sv":26489},"pll_sync_post":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/26485"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/16"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=26485"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/26485\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":26492,"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/26485\/revisions\/26492"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/26482"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=26485"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=26485"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=26485"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
