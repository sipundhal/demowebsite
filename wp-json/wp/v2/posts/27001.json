For more than two decades, the firm has each year been elected \u201cbest in class\u201d among law firms in Universum&#8217;s annual student survey, F\u00f6retagsBarometern.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to being voted the most popular law firm, Mannheimer Swartling has also won the title as the most attractive employer in the entire legal sector for the fifth time. Jan Dernestam, Managing Partner at Mannheimer Swartling, is delighted with the achievement:<\/p>\n<p>\u2013 We are incredibly proud to be named the most popular law firm by the country\u2019s law students for the 22nd year in a row. To also be named the most attractive employer in the entire legal sector of course makes us even prouder. It\u2019s an honour and a vote of confidence for which we are truly grateful, says Jan.<\/p>\n<p>\u2013 We are committed to continuously improving our leadership, culture and values to maintain our position as the employer of choice for Sweden\u2019s legal professionals. Our goal is to deliver the absolute best legal advice in the market, and that starts with attracting the very best people.<\/p>\n<p>\u2013 One of the reasons we are consistently voted the most attractive law firm is our ability to foster a collaborative culture where teamwork and support are prioritised. We have created a workplace where everyone feels valued and enjoys coming to work, Jan concludes.<\/p>\n<p>The F\u00f6retagsBarometern survey, conducted by Universum, is a comprehensive student survey on careers, working life and the future. Around 25,000 students from Swedish universities and colleges participate and vote for Sweden\u2019s 100 most attractive employers.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mannheimer Swartling has once again confirmed its position as the most attractive law firm among Swedish law students.
