Our greatest opportunity to contribute to sustainable development lies in what we do best: business law. Companies, organisations and industries face varying opportunities and challenges, not least in the area of sustainability. The best business law advice must therefore include not only legal expertise but tailored solutions with business in focus.<\/p>\n<p>2022 was a difficult year for large parts of the world. Russia&#8217;s brutal invasion of Ukraine caused immense human suffering, and also sent shockwaves through the global economy. As a consequence of the war, we took the decision on 25 February, the day after the invasion, to close down our entire Russian operations after more than 30 years of presence in the country.<\/p>\n<p>During the past year, the legislator has clearly signalled that businesses must take greater responsibility in creating sustainable value chains. Furthermore, the business world awaits sweeping legislative changes to corporate sustainability reporting. Proactivity is thus becoming increasingly important and business law sustainability expertise and advice are needed now more than ever.<\/p>\n<p>We took a number of sustainability initiatives throughout 2022, including:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sustainable by Design<\/strong> \u2013 a new concept developed as a way to strategically incorporate sustainability into our business<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sustainability and ESG<\/strong> \u2013 a new industry group founded to ensure the integration of sustainability into all areas of our client advice<\/p>\n<p><strong>Diversity and inclusion<\/strong> \u2013 a clearer equality goal adopted at partner level to strengthen our work with diversity and inclusion<\/p>\n<p><strong>Business and Human Rights Lawyers Association (BHRLA)<\/strong> \u2013 co-founded and launched as a vehicle to collaborate with other law firms and accelerate the work with business and human rights<\/p>\n<p><strong>Net Zero<\/strong> \u2013 we joined the Net Zero Lawyers Alliance to accelerate the net zero transition<\/p>\n<p><strong>Climate Targets<\/strong> \u2013 our climate targets were approved after an independent assessment by the Science Based Targets initiative<\/p>\n<p>We are looking forward to the year ahead, to seeing the results of our investments in strategic sustainability and to creating even value through our advisory service.<\/p>\n<p>We invite you to read the Swedish version of our sustainability report 2022 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/app\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Mannheimer-Swartling-Hallbarhetsrapport-2022.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our society faces many sustainability challenges and these also have an impact on Mannheimer Swartling.
