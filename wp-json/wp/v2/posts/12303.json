S\u00f6derberg &amp; Partners, represented by Mannheimer Swartling, has insisted on a right to judicial review in case of such disagreement, i.e. concerning which documents the Swedish Competition Authority is entitled to copy. The Supreme Court now establishes that the Swedish Competition Authority was wrong to act in a way which denied S\u00f6derberg &amp; Partners that right. The Supreme Court also finds that S\u00f6derberg &amp; Partners is entitled to damages as a result of the wrongdoing. As a consequence, the Swedish Competition Authority has changed its procedures relating to the copying of documents during investigations.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In an ongoing investigation with the Swedish Competition Authority, disagreement arose as to which documents the Swedish Competition Authority was entitled to copy.
