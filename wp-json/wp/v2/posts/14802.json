Commission members are eleven of Sweden&#8217;s most prominent experts within a number of strategically important reform areas. Chairman is Klas Eklund, Senior Economist at Mannheimer Swartling.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; There are many terrible aspects of the ongoing crisis. I am proud and impressed with the vast expertise represented in the Restart Commission. The fact that some of the country&#8217;s leading experts were able to join forces on such short notice shows just how important the task is. Everyone wants to help, says Klas Eklund. Our work \u2013 to create multidimensional proposal for a stronger Sweden \u2013 begins immediately, he concludes.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; The crisis is taking its toll on Sweden and we must now create a strategic reform agenda. We have to do what we can to minimize damage on the Swedish business community and prepare for a fresh start that will enable Sweden to emerge from the crisis even stronger than before. The firm is very pleased to be able to help with this important work by providing our qualified investigative resources, assisting with legal analysees, and drafting any proposals for new legislation. In addition, Klas Eklund will of course spend a great deal of his working time chairing the new Commission, says Jan Dernestam, Managing Partner at Mannheimer Swartling.<\/p>\n<p>Read more about the Restart Commission by following the links below.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dn.se\/debatt\/vi-tar-fram-en-handfast-plan-for-en-omstart-av-sverige\">https:\/\/www.dn.se\/debatt\/vi-tar-fram-en-handfast-plan-for-en-omstart-av-sverige<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.chamber.se\/nyheter\/nu-lanseras-omstartskommissionen-for-reformer-som.htm\">https:\/\/www.chamber.se\/nyheter\/nu-lanseras-omstartskommissionen-for-reformer-som.htm<\/a><\/p>\n<p>For more information, please contact:<\/p>\n<p>Jan Dernestam, managing partner<br \/>\n+46 70 977 73 48, <a href=\"mailto:jan.dernestam@msa.se\">jan.dernestam@msa.se<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Helena Sj\u00f6holm, Head of Marketing and Communication<br \/>\n+46 70 977 79 34, <a href=\"mailto:helena.sjoholm@msa.se\">helena.sjoholm@msa.se<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Stockholm Chamber of Commerce has established Omstartskommissionen (the Restart Commission) \u2013 an initiative to reboot and strengthen Sweden after the corona crisis.
