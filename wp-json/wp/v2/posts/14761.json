The new office, situated adjacent to the\u00a0<em>Singapore International Arbitration Centre\u00a0(SIAC)<\/em> and the world leading\u00a0<em>International Court of Arbitration\u00a0(ICC)<\/em>, will serve as the hub for the firm&#8217;s dispute resolution practice in Asia.<\/p>\n<p>Singapore continues to attract an ever increasing number of international disputes. The establishment of the new Singapore office is therefore a natural step for Mannheimer Swartling&#8217;s top-tier international arbitration practice.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Singapore is attracting more and more major international arbitrations. We believe that this development will not only continue, but rather accelerate, says Jan Dernestam, Managing Partner at Mannheimer Swartling.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Singapore is already an important hub for major investments and business negotiations. The legal environment is attractive for foreign companies doing business in Asia. With the establishment of our new office and a new\u00a0China\/APAC desk\u00a0in Sweden, we continue to assist our clients with their business in China and Asia at large. This way, we build on our unique competence and experience from the firm&#8217;s long standing presence in Shanghai and Hong Kong. I am excited to see what lies ahead, says Jakob Ragnwaldh, Partner in Mannheimer Swartling&#8217;s Dispute Resolution practice group, based in Singapore.<\/p>\n<p>The Dispute Resolution team in Singapore is fully integrated with the firm&#8217;s Dispute Resolution practice group in Sweden and Moscow, as well as with the rest of the firm&#8217;s lawyers.
