The patent protects the once daily use of rivaroxaban, the active ingredient in Bayer\u2019s blockbuster drug Xarelto\u00ae, for the treatment of thromboembolic disorders. Sandoz alleged that the patent was invalid due to lack of inventive step. A six-day main hearing took place in late 2023.<\/p>\n<p>Bayer was successful in defending the patent. On 1 February 2024, the court issued its judgment (case number PMT 16592-22), dismissing Sandoz\u2019s request in its entirety and awarding Bayer compensation for litigation costs.
