The dispute arose out of a significant infrastructure project (on a Build-Operate-Transfer basis) with the aim of increasing water supply to Amman. As project company, Diwaco was responsible for drilling 55 water wells in the south of Jordan and constructing a 325 km water conveyance system to transport the water to Amman, in the north of Jordan.<\/p>\n<p>Diwaco initiated the ad hoc UNCITRAL arbitration in March 2015 and the final award was rendered on 22 February 2018. The arbitral tribunal dismissed Diwaco&#8217;s claim, save for some USD 2.5 million, and upheld the entirety of Jordan&#8217;s counterclaim, ordering Diwaco to pay USD 10 million in liquidated damages for project delay, as well as USD 12 million for Jordan&#8217;s legal and experts costs and the fees and costs of the arbitral tribunal.<\/p>\n<p>Mannheimer Swartling&#8217;s international projects team has supported Jordan with legal advice in several large water investments over the years, including the contract documentation for the As-Samra wastewater treatment plant and the Disi project that was the subject of the now concluded arbitration.<\/p>\n<p>Mannheimer Swartling&#8217;s team consisted of lawyers from the practice groups Dispute Resolution and Infrastructure\/Construction.
