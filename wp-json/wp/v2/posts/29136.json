The purpose of the directive is, among other things, to improve the working conditions for those working via digital platforms.<\/p>\n<p>Technological development has changed the working life and created opportunities for new services and jobs through digital work platforms. While the rise of platform work has benefited companies and created growth, it has also led to new business models that in some cases may risk creating uncertainty about who is considered an employee.<\/p>\n<p>To strengthen the rights of platform workers and clarify who should be considered an employee, the European Parliament and the Council have adopted the so-called platform directive, which must be implemented in member states by December 2, 2026.<\/p>\n<p>Against this background, a special investigator has been tasked with investigating how the EU directive should be implemented, with the Swedish labor market model being a central starting point.<\/p>\n<p>&#8221;People employed in the gig economy should have good working conditions and a good work environment just like everyone else in the labor market.
