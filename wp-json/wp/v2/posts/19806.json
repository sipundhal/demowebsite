The new rules are set out in the Act (2021:579) on the prohibition of unfair trading practices in the purchase of agricultural and food products, also known as the UTP Act, which transposes an EU Directive into Swedish law.<\/p>\n<p>There are currently a large number of questions on how the Act&#8217;s provisions will be applied and many companies have reason to consider whether they are affected by the rules, directly or indirectly. A new dedicated unit of the Swedish Competition Authority has been entrusted with the task of enforcing the new Act, and Mannheimer Swartling&#8217;s EU and competition law group is following the development closely, in dialogue with authorities and industries concerned.<\/p>\n<p>Mannheimer Swartling has previously circulated an overview of the new legislation, see link below. Throughout the year, the firm&#8217;s EU and competition law group has also assisted a large number of clients with advice on how the new rules will affect their businesses.
