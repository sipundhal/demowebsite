Despite warnings of overheating and geopolitical storm clouds, 2017 was characterised by high activity in all our practice groups and geographic markets. We are very proud that in 2017 the firm was once again ranked as the most attractive law firm to work for by Swedish law students. This accolade has now been awarded to us for the 15th year in a row. We expect a high level of commitment and ambition from everyone we employ. In return, we offer a generous and open work environment. We are all true team players and expect the same of our new employees. Together we form a powerful collective where the team is more important than the self.<\/p>\n<p>Continuous change management and well-developed adaptability are prerequisites for us to continue to be relevant and sought-after advisers. Our aim is to be in the absolute forefront, ahead of both clients and competitors when identifying trends and tendencies before they become realities. It is for this reason in 2014 that we employed a Head of Sustainability. At the time, Mannheimer Swartling was the first business law firm in Sweden to appoint a person with specific responsibility for sustainability issues. Four years later, we take the next step in the same direction as we recruit Klas Eklund as our Senior Economist. Klas Eklund is one of Sweden&#8217;s most renowned economists and former chief economist at SEB. He will be a great asset both for the firm and our clients when predicting where the world is heading.<\/p>\n<p>Mannheimer Swartling&#8217;s strategic sustainability work consists of advising clients, improving our own internal sustainability performance, as well as the firm&#8217;s pro bono commitment. As a further step, we are now combining our annual report and sustainability report for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>We welcome you to read more about the firm&#8217;s activities during the past year in our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mannheimerswartling.se\/app\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Annual-and-sustainability-report-2017.pdf\">Annual and Sustainability Report for 2017.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>2017 has been a year of high business activity and dynamic change.
