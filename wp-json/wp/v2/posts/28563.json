The agreement is entered into due to the ongoing review procedure regarding the procurement of the metro system operations in Stockholm, which was awarded in January 2024 (E40).<\/p>\n<p>The current agreement for the operation of the metro system expires on 1 November 2025, and cannot be extended. To avoid traffic disruptions, SL has decided to enter into a temporary agreement with Connecting Stockholm AB, the tenderer who was awarded the E40 procurement. The assignment value for E40 is estimated to approximately SEK forty billion.<\/p>\n<p>The temporary agreement is, in essence, consistent with the terms of the E40 agreement, but may only remain in force for a period of up to two years following the commencement of operations. Under the temporary agreement, Connecting Stockholm will assume the comprehensive responsibility for the operation of the metro system on 2 November 2025.<\/p>\n<p>Mannheimer Swartling advised SL in the project.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Public Transportation Administration in the Stockholm Region (SL) has entered into a temporary agreement for the operation of the Stockholm metro system.
