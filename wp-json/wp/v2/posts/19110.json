The course will take place at Mannheimer Swartling&#8217;s office in Stockholm. The themes of the course this year are: fair trial and anti-corruption.<\/p>\n<p>This year 13 lawyers from four continents participate, including countries such as Malawi, Costa Rica, China, Nepal and Macedonia. During the week, they participate in seminars, workshops and lectures on fair trial and anti-corruption, all within the context of the central theme, human rights. The aim is to discuss development of democracy, human rights and the construction of a functioning legal system. This is achieved by letting the participants co-create a &#8221;tool box&#8221; that enables, develops and facilitates their daily work with human rights.<\/p>\n<p>The course is led by representatives from the Raoul Wallenberg Institute, Mannheimer Swartling and the MacArthur Center at University Mississippi School of Law as well as delegates from several major Swedish companies and influential stakeholders.<\/p>\n<p>Mannheimer Swartling&#8217;s co-operation with the Raoul Wallenberg Institute falls within the framework of the firm&#8217;s work on sustainability. By combining the expertise and experience of a leading Swedish Law Firm with a clear human rights engagement and the knowledge of the Raoul Wallenberg Institute when it comes to development cooperation but also protection and promotion of human rights, a solid ground is set for an informative and fulfilling course. Since its establishment in 2007, more than 90 lawyers from 25 different nationalities have participated in the course.
