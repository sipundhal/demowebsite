The first edition of the guide was published in 2014. Since then, the SCC has issued new arbitration rules in 2017 and the Swedish Arbitration Act of 1999 was partly revised in 2019. At the same time, the Swedish courts have continued to develop Swedish arbitration law with a number of important judgments. The second edition of the guide has been updated to reflect these developments.<\/p>\n<p>&#8221;Concise Guide to Arbitration in Sweden&#8221; provides the essentials for anyone participating in arbitration in Sweden and addresses commercial arbitration as well as investment arbitration. The book also provides essential guidance on those aspects of contract law which will usually be relevant in a contractual dispute governed by Swedish substantive law. Finally, it provides practical information for lawyers visiting Sweden.<\/p>\n<p>The authors are Robin Oldenstam, Kristoffer L\u00f6f, Alexander Foerster, Azadeh Razani, Fredrik Ringquist and Aron Skogman and they are all members of the practice group for dispute resolution at Mannheimer Swartling.
