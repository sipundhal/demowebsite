The EMTN bonds and hybrid bonds, being in an aggregate nominal amount of approximately EUR\u00a05.4 billion, will also remain listed on the London Stock Exchange. The EMTN bonds are the first of their kind to be listed at Nasdaq Stockholm.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cVattenfall is a European energy company with its headquarters in Stockholm and sizable operations both in Sweden and in Europe. Having our EMTN program governed under Swedish law will contribute to improved efficiency and simplicity in our financial operations\u201d, says Anna Borg, CFO at Vattenfall.<\/p>\n<p>&#8221;We are very happy to have had the opportunity to act as Vattenfall\u2019s Swedish adviser in this ground breaking project\u201d, says Andr\u00e9 Andersson, Head of Mannheimer Swartling\u2019s Banking and Finance group. \u201cBy making only limited amendments to the international standard for EMTN programs, mainly with inspiration from similar programs under German law, Vattenfall has managed to establish a Swedish law governed program and produce a prospectus which are very similar to the formats that international investors are used to\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are excited to welcome Vattenfall to the Nasdaq family, and for them to be the first company to list bonds under an EMTN program on our market,\u201d says Ann-Charlotte Eliasson, VP and Head of Nordic Fixed Income Listings at Nasdaq. \u201cWe have seen an increasing interest among Nordic issuers to list their bonds at our markets, but until now EMTN bonds have been the exception to that rule. With stable and liquid capital markets certain to remain within the Europan Union for the forseeable future, Nasdaq\u2019s Nordic Bond Market should be the natural choice for all Nordic issuers and also a strong alternative for any European company looking to list their bond loans at a globally recognized exchange\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Vattenfall is a leading European energy company that employs approximately 20,000 people and has operations mainly in Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, the UK and Finland.
